    <h1>Hello and welcome!</h1>
    <p>
      Thank you for checking in on my wonderful page that is...mostly empty right now.
      But it won't be in the future!

      Besides my own real-world life, I'm actively working towards having a fully fleshed out page.
      It will contain a lot about myself, and as for my current work, you can check it out yourself on my GitHub page. (well...here as of now)

      Thank you for visiting, and I hope to see you when this page is done!
    </p>
